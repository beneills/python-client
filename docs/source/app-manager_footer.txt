Usage examples
--------------

If ``-u`` is not specified, the default user is used.

Installing applications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- If you want to install a new JAR file containing applications, simply type::

        genestack-application-manager install my-version path/to/file.jar


- If your JAR file is located in a specific folder, and this folder and its subfolders do not contain any other JAR file,
  you can specify the path to the folder instead of the full path to the JAR file. In that case, the folder and its subfolders
  will be searched for JAR files. If no JAR file or more than one JAR file is found, an error is returned.

    genestack-application-manager install my-version path/to/folder


- If you want to upload a JAR file and also mark all the applications inside it as stable for your current user, you can use ``-s`` option of the ``install`` command (the default scope for marking applications as stable is ``user``)::

    genestack-application-manager install -s my-version path/to/file.jar

- If you want to make an applications stable only for your session, you should specify ``-S session``::

    genestack-application-manager install -s -S session my-version path/to/file.jar

- Otherwise, you can use the ``stable`` command after installing the JAR file::

    JAR=path/to/file.jar
    VERSION=my-version
    genestack-application-manager install $VERSION $JAR
    for A in $(genestack-application-manager info $JAR | tail -n+3); do
        genestack-application-manager stable -S system $VERSION $A
    done

- If you want to reinstall your applications later with the same version (whether or not that version was marked as stable),
  you can simply use the ``-o`` option for the ``install`` command

  This option works exactly as removing the old version before uploading the new one, so there are two things to keep in mind:
  -  ``-o`` can be used to overwrite only your versions, because you cannot overwrite or remove versions uploaded by other users;
  -  ``-o`` removes the global stable mark, so if you overwrite a globally stable version, then after that no globally stable version will be available on the system


    genestack-application-manager install -o my-version path/to/file.jar

- Sometimes you may want to upload a JAR file with many applications, and only mark as stable one of them.
  In this case you should use the ``install`` and ``stable`` commands::

    genestack-application-manager install my-version path/to/file.jar
    genestack-application-manager stable my-version vendor/appIdFromJarFile

Removing all of your applications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- If you want to remove all your applications, you can use the following bash script::

    for A in $(genestack-application-manager applications); do
        for V in $(genestack-application-manager versions -o $A); do
            genestack-application-manager remove $V $A
        done
    done

- And if you want to remove only those your applications that were loaded from a specific JAR file, then::

    JAR=path/to/file.jar
    for A in $(genestack-application-manager info $JAR | tail -n+3); do
        for V in $(genestack-application-manager versions -o $A); do
            genestack-application-manager remove $V $A
        done
    done
