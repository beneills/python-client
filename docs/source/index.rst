Welcome to python SDK's documentation
=====================================


Python SDK will help you to automate server interactions.

What can be done with python SDK? Anything you can do via browser.
You can call same methods with same arguments that you call from browser and get output in json format.

Typical usages:
  * upload many files at once
  * create / update files with cla application
  * debug your own application
  * measure time of execution

All communication to server uses `HTTPS <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure>`_.
